This is a simple task management app being built from the ground up to explore using LLMs for easier, faster capturing of tasks, thoughts, notes, and ideas. 

Everything on the app is designed to run locally except for the LLM processing, and if you do copy the code (go right ahead!) make sure you're adding your own API keys and selecting your model of choice. 

Future versions will add more of the things you're used to from task managers, and also playing around with different ways to handle your tasks. Maybe some cloud storage and syncing options. Probably something annoying here and there too.

If you do copy the code, just know it's under a Creative Commons license, so you can't sell it as your own. 

And if you'd like to contribute, let me know!
